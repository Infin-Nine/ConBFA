# ConBFA  – Continuous Biometric Face Authentication 🔐

ConBFA (Continuous Biometric Face Authentication) is a next-generation security system designed to move beyond traditional, one-time authentication models toward continuous, real-time identity verification.

Unlike conventional systems that authenticate a user only at login, ConBFA continuously verifies the user’s presence and identity throughout the entire session.

Problem Statement

Modern authentication systems suffer from a critical flaw:

Once a user is authenticated, the system blindly trusts the session, even if the user leaves the device or an unauthorized person takes control.

This creates serious security risks in environments handling:

Sensitive intellectual property

Confidential documents

Financial or defense-related systems

High-value enterprise workstations

Traditional screen locks and password-based systems do not provide real-time protection once access is granted.

Solution: Continuous Trust Enforcement

ConBFA introduces continuous biometric authentication, where trust is not permanent—it must be constantly proven.

Core principles:

Trust is dynamic, not static

Authentication is continuous, not one-time

Access exists only while the authorized user is present

Current Version (v1) – Concept Validation

The current release of ConBFA represents Version 1, which is in an experimental testing phase.

Purpose of v1:

Validate the feasibility of continuous face-based authentication

Demonstrate immediate system response on authentication failure

Prove that biometric trust can be enforced at the OS level in real time

At this stage:

The system continuously verifies the enrolled user

If the user disappears or an unknown face is detected, the Windows workstation is locked automatically

Windows lock is intentionally used as a clear proof-of-concept, making system behavior visible and measurable

This version is designed to prove the idea, not to represent the final product.

Future versions of ConBFA will evolve into a full continuous access control platform, capable of protecting far more than just the screen.

Planned evolution includes:

1. Continuous Session Control

Authorized user present → system operates normally

Authorization lost → access is revoked immediately

2. Granular Resource Security

Instead of locking the entire system, ConBFA will support:

Application-level protection

Sensitive document and file locking

Resource-specific access enforcement

Protected resources will remain accessible only while continuous authentication is maintained.

3. Zero-Trust Architecture

ConBFA aligns with zero-trust security principles:

No implicit trust

Continuous verification

Instant revocation on failure

Secure Resource Demonstration (In Development)

Beyond system locking, ConBFA already includes resource-locking components that demonstrate how sensitive assets can be protected dynamically.

These components:

Lock specific applications, files, or resources

Unlock them only when the authorized user is continuously authenticated

Automatically re-lock resources upon authentication failure

A visual or web-based demonstration of this mechanism is planned to showcase real-time resource protection, not just device locking.

Market Direction

ConBFA is not designed for mass consumer devices.

Primary target markets include:

Enterprise security solutions

Research & development labs

Defense and government systems

Secure financial or vault environments

Custom B2B security deployments

The system is intended to be highly customizable, allowing organizations to define:

What resources are protected

How strict authentication should be

How quickly access is revoked
